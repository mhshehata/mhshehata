# Mohamed Shehata - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
As an Energy Engineer with a strong background in energy engineering and economics, I've dedicated my career to the energy sector. My experience spans various roles, including data modelling and analytics, production, project management, and market analysis. This diverse background equips me with a unique perspective and valuable skills that are well-suited for a data analyst role.

I have honed my data analysis abilities through academic coursework and professional experience, employing a diverse array of software tools such as Python, SQL, MATLAB, GAMS, Tableau, and Microsoft Excel.


This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects, and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analyzing the Levelized Cost of Hydrogen

**Code:** [Analyzing_levelized_cost_of_hydrogen.ipynb`](https://github.com/mhshehata/Analyzing_levelized_cost_of_hydrogen/blob/main/LCOH%20of%20SMR%20%26%20Electrolyzer%20-%20Germany.ipynb)


**Description:** This analysis compares the levelized cost of hydrogen production of the steam methane reforming and water electrolysis process. For this purpose, Germanyâ€™s national strategy for producing hydrogen via electrolysis capacity of 5 GW by 2030 is modeled on Python.

**Skills:** 

EDA, Linear Regression, Sensitivity Analysis, Data Visualization.

**Technology:** 
- Python: pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn


### Customers Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

**Code:** [TravelTide-Customer-Segmentation-Perks-Assignment.ipynb](https://github.com/mhshehata/TravelTide-Customer-Segmentation-Perks-Assignment/blob/main/TravelTide_Customer_Segmentation_%26_Perks_Assignment_Project.ipynb)

**Description:** The goal of this project is to segment customers in the TravelTide database into five different segments based on their spending patterns, booking habits, and travel preferences. Based on these segments, we will assign customers to one of five relevant perks. These perks are intended to foster customer loyalty, increase engagement, and improve overall satisfaction.

**Skills:** 

EDA, Data Cleaning and Aggregation, Feature Engineering, K-Means Clustering, Data Visualization

**Technology:** 
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQLALchemy, scikit-learn
  
- SQL: Joins, CTE's, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Converting Data Types
