# Mohamed Shehata - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
I am an Energy Engineer with a great interest in data analytics and modeling, especially in the Energy Sector. 

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

My CV in [pdf](https://github.com/tiannaparris/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Tianna%20Parris%20CV.pdf).

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analyzing the Levelized Cost of Hydrogen
**Code:** [Analyzing_levelized_cost_of_hydrogen.ipynb`](https://github.com/mhshehata/Analyzing_levelized_cost_of_hydrogen/blob/main/LCOH%20of%20SMR%20%26%20Electrolyzer%20-%20Germany.ipynb)

**Goal:** 

**Description:** This analysis compares the levelized cost of hydrogen production of the steam methane reforming and water electrolysis process. For this purpose, Germany’s national strategy for producing hydrogen via electrolysis capacity of 5 GW by 2030 is modeled on Python.

**Skills:** 
EDA, Linear Regression, Data Visualization.

**Technology:** 
Python: pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

**Results:** 

### Customers Segmentation Using K-Means Clsutering

**Goal:** To examine the sales history of the store and extract insights on its performance, as well as to identify potential improvements that can be implemented.

**Code:** [TravelTide-Customer-Segmentation-Perks-Assignment.ipynb](https://github.com/mhshehata/TravelTide-Customer-Segmentation-Perks-Assignment/blob/main/TravelTide_Customer_Segmentation_%26_Perks_Assignment_Project.ipynb)

**Description:** The goal of this project is to segment customers in the TravelTide database into five different segments based on their spending patterns, booking habits, and travel preferences. Based on these segments, we will assign customers to one of five relevant perks. These perks are intended to foster customer loyalty, increase engagement, and improve overall satisfaction.

**Skills:** 
EDA, Data Cleaning and Aggregation, Feature Engineering, K-Means Clustering, Data Visualization

**Technology:** 
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQLALchemy, scikit-learn
  
SQL: Joins, CTE's, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Converting Data Types

**Results:** 



### Nashville Housing Data Cleaning
**Code:** [`Data Cleaning Project Queries: Nashville Housing.sql`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20Project%20Queries:%20Nashville%20Housing.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of houses that have been sold in Nashville between 2013 and 2019. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing.


**Skills:** DML(Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language).

**Technology:** SQL Server


### Covid 19 Data Exploration
**Code:** [`COVID Portfolio Project.sql`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/COVID%20Portfolio%20Project.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

**Technology:** SQL Server



### Legendary Pokémon Analysis

**Goal:** To predict Pokémon status based on their characteristics and rank their importance in determining whether a Pokémon is classified as legendary.

**Code:** [`Legendary Pokémon Analysis (Study Project)`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Legendary%20Pok%C3%A9mon%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of  Pokémon.  The records include their characteristics such as attack, defense, type and size. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing characteristics of different Pokémon.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Tidyverse
